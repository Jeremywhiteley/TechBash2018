# (Fr)Agile: How Agile Falls Apart (and what you can do to hold it all together)

Presented by Sean Killeen @ TechBash 2018.

Up to date slides available at <https://seankilleen.com/Presentations/2018-10_Fragile>.

You can check out the presentation from <http://github.com/SeanKilleen/Presentations>. I'd post it here but I have font-awesome and some other stuff as part of the repo so I can pull it down locally for off-line scenarios; figured I'd save the bytes on this repo. If you want it here, feel free to make a PR and add it; you have my full permission. :)

Thanks for a great year, TechBash!
