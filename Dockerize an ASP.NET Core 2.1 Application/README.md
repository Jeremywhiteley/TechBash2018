## Introduction
Docker is a tool that can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container to run on any computer. It helps enable flexibility and portability on where the application can run. ASP.NET Core is an open source, cross platform, performant, and scalable web application framework. The modularity and lightweight nature of .NET Core makes it perfect for containers. Today, I am going to give a brief introduction of Docker and show everybody how to run an ASP.NET Core 2.1 Application in Docker containers.
