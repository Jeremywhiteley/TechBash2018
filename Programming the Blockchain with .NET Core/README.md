# Programming the Blockchain with .NET Core

Henry He


## Session Introduction
A Blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, and encrypted database for recording transactions. It becomes one of the technologies that got a lot of attentions this year. People even said that the Blockchain will become “the New Internet”. As software developers, we need to understand Blockchain, try Blockchain, and be ready for the disruption introduced by the Blockchain. I have been learning and trying Blockchain for a while. I founded a Blockchain club at my company. I created Blockchain Applications at Hackathons. Today, I am going to give a brief introduction of Blockchain and show everybody how to programming the Blockchain with .NET Core.
